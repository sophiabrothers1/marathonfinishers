Hereâ€™s an improved and engaging version of your subtitle:

Subtitle:
"How age, gender, nationality, and race experience shape the journey to faster finishes."

This phrasing keeps the focus on the key factors while adding a dynamic, narrative tone. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!

The error message you're seeing suggests that there is a LaTeX issue related to missing math mode indicators (i.e., the $ symbols) or improper syntax, particularly when using the tblr environment from the tabularray package.

This error typically occurs when a mathematical expression is not properly enclosed in math mode (with $...$ for inline math or \[...\] for display math). However, since the error is happening at the \end{tblr} line, it suggests that there might be an issue inside the tblr table environment before it ends.

for country in iaaf_cateogry only include if more than 25 datapoints. dataset is marathon_data_cleaned

To only include countries (IAAF categories) that have more than 25 data points, we can filter the dataset for those countries before proceeding with the predictions. You can achieve this by counting the number of occurrences of each iaaf_category (country), filtering the categories that have more than 25 data points, and then making predictions on the filtered data.

Here's the modified code:

1. Filter Countries with More than 25 Data Points
You can use the dplyr package to group by iaaf_category and filter those countries that have more than 25 records.

r
Copy code
# Filter for IAAF categories with more than 25 data points
marathon_data_filtered <- marathon_data_cleaned %>%
  group_by(iaaf_category) %>%
  filter(n() > 25) %>%
  ungroup()
